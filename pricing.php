            <h2>Class Fees</h2>
            <p>Most martial arts schools will not give their prices out, either online or over the phone. Go ahead. Call a few. We will wait….. See what I mean? Why this level of secrecy? Unbelievable isn’t it?</p>
            <p>While you are waiting for a direct answer from the other schools (which I’m sure you are still waiting), consider these offers:</p>
            <h3>12 Class Pass: $150 (No contract)</h3>
            <p>This is a no-contract option for those who want to pay-as-they-go. Includes martial arts, self defense, or fitness classes. Classes do not have to be sequential classes. The only other cost to get started is the purchase of a uniform ($29.99). That’s it. </p>
            <h3>Fitness Only: $79 per month</h3>
            <p>This is a great option for adults who are looking to get in shape but are tired of the regular gym. You will receive more 1-on-1 coaching than any CrossFit gym or group fitness class, as well as receive workouts to do at home, in the gym, or on the road.</p>
            <h3>Martial Arts for Adults: As low as $129 per month* | Martial Arts of Kids: As low as $109 per month*</h3>
            <p>These options are priced differently based on your program choice. The kids and teens program is 2-3 days per week, while the adults programs are 3-6 days per week. Give us a call today to discuss your goals, and we will recommend a program best suited to you!</p>
            <h3>Family Options: Starting at $225 per month*</h3>
            <p>Families that train strong together, stay strong together. Additional members are discounted as much as 30% off per month.</p>
            <h3>Paid in Full Options:</h3>
            <p>We offer a Bi-yearly or yearly, no contract, no gimmicks option for all of our programs. Pricing is dependent on your program choice.</p>
            <p><i>*Monthly fees will ultimately depend on length of membership, membership type, and number of members. Enrollment fees are not included in the prices above. Month-to-month options available after initial term. Monthly discounts also available for Military, First Responder, and Students. Give us a call today to discuss specific options and ask about setting up an appointment to come experience a class.</i></p>

            <h2>Note From Sifu:</h2>
            <p>Why do I include this level of transparency, you ask? It starts with a simple belief that you should be informed, and given direct and honest answers. I also believe that if a person cannot be honest and direct with the cost of their program, then they are not capable of being honest and direct when coaching you, training you, and believing in you to achieve your goals.</p>
            <p>And furthermore, why would you even want to train at a place that can’t won’t give you a straight answer to your questions? Why would you want to train at a place whose instructors seem more like sleazy, used-car salesmen than genuine coaches with your best interest in mind? At Southeast JKD, you will never walk in and feel like you aren’t welcomed, or are forgotten the moment you sign up.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, this also sets the standard of the quality of martial arts we teach. Southeast JKD is an athletic club dedicated to the success of our members. That is what drives us, and this is what we do on a daily basis. We offer low student-instructor ratios, personalized feedback, and an inclusive atmosphere. To accomplish this, I do not believe you should be required to sign up for a long-term, 3 year “Black Belt” training contract to keep you as a student. Nor do I believe that you will receive the same level of attention and focus on your goals for $40 per month at some other gym or academy. But don’t take my word for it. Give me a call and schedule a time to come by and experience a class. Only then can you decide what is right for you.</p>
