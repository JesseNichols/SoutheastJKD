            <h3>Functional Fitness and Conditioning</h3>

                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9a8KuSrCfzY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>Action Strength is the art and science of functional fitness and athletic development. It is a complete portable functional fitness training system. It combines kettlebell, bodyweight, and Indian mace exercises along with Tai Chi and Qigong to develop athleticism and skill in a minimal amount of time. It is designed to compliment martial arts training to develop a complete athlete and fighter.</p>
            <p>We feel functional strength training to be of the utmost importance when it come to your day to day work and functional daily habits. Often times fitness crazes will preach their effectiveness or functional benefits when in fact they lead to improper mechanics that neglect flexibility and natural motion. These types of workouts create overuse injuries and undo stresses to the body.</p>
            <p>We teach a Functional Strength Training protocol that allows anyone – beginner or athlete - to obtain a functionally sound workout through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Proper breathing and breath control</li>
                <li>Strength exercises for muscular development and endurance</li>
                <li>Mobility exercises for warmup, pre-hab and natural motion</li>
                <li>Indian Club training for core and functional applications</li>
                <li>Bodyweight and Stability Ball training</li>
                <li>Kettlebell and other ballistic exercises</li>
                <li>Dynamic Tension applications</li>
            </ul>
            <p><q>Training for Strength and Flexibility is a must. You must use it to support your techniques. Techniques alone are no good if you don’t support them with strength and flexibility.</q>

            <h3>Filipino Marital Arts</h3>
            <p>Our Filipino Martial Arts class incorporates elements from both Western and Eastern Martial Arts. The most popular forms of which are known as Arnis/Eskrima/Kali. The intrinsic need for self-preservation was the genesis of these systems. The Filipino Martial Arts, perpetuated by Guro Dan Inosanto and his students, is generally known as Inosanto/LaCoste Kali or JKD/Kali Blend. Practitioners of Inosanto/LaCoste Kali prefer not to attach limiting labels or names to their expression of Filipino martial arts. In that spirit, we incorporate practical methods from Filipino Kali, Eskima, Indonesian Silat, and others.</p>
            <img src="_images/filipino.jpg" alt="" class="right inline">
            <p>Filipino Kali/Escrima has been used in many popular movies and shows:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Bourne Identity, Supremacy, Ultimatum and Legacy (Matt Damon)</li>
                    <li>Mission Impossible 4 (Tom Cruise)</li>
                    <li>Resident Evil (Milla Jollovich)</li>
                    <li>The Book Of Eli (Denzel Washington)</li>
                    <li>Spartacus (Showtime Series)</li>
                    <li>Star Wars (Episodes I, II and III)</li>
                    <li>Batman (Christian Bale)</li>
                    <li>Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Not only does Kali look good on camera, but its effectiveness is battle-tested in real life situations.</p>
            <p>We take a practical and realistic approach to our Filipino Martial Arts training. Weapons are force amplifiers that are a reality of life. This is why our focus is not on weapon disarms or extravagant techniques, but instead they are the basics of evading, neutralizing and escaping a bad situation.</p>
            <h3>Freestyle Grappling</h3>
            <p>As our entire curriculum emphasizes practical self defense methods, our Freestyle Grappling is an amalgamation of standing grappling and ground-fighting methods found in many different arts. Western Wrestling, Submission Arts Wrestling, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Nihon Ryu Jujitsu, Judo, Kali Dumog and Silat make up a significant part of our grappling curriculum.</p>
            <img src="_images/grappling.jpg" alt="" class="right inline">
            <p>These arts are seamlessly integrated with striking to create our Freestyle Grappling curriculum. There is heavy emphasis on grappling fundamentals and the self defense aspects of close quarters fighting. While we thoroughly encourage competition, it is by far not the only means in which the art can be performed and appreciated.</p>
            <p>Our Grappling classes include the full range of fighting possibilities, which include techniques from both standing and grounded positions.</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Standing Grappling / Trapping, Clinch work and Takedowns</li>
                    <li>Positional and Space Control</li>
                    <li>Escapes and Reversals</li>
                    <li>Striking</li>
                    <li>Submission / Locks / Chokes and Strangles</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Jeet Kune Do and Kali</h3>
            <p>Functionality and adaptability are the two main principles that we seek to train in this class. What this means is that you will learn to fight in all ranges of combat from standing (boxing, Thai boxing and Savate), trapping and in-fighting (Wing Chun), ground fighting (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu), as well as with weapons (Kali and Escrima). All arts are blended and trained together to teach combat flow and adaptability. Only by adapting to the situation will you be able to survive any kid of attack that may occur, ranging from standing, grappling, weapons or multiple opponent attacks. What this means is that you will gain the ability to defend yourself in any scenario and you will understand how to truly “be like water.” This is an intermediate / advanced level class. Must test out of beginners to attend.</p>
