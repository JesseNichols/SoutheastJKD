            <h2>About SEJKD</h2>
            <p>Southeast Jeet Kune Do is an athletic club seeking to promote realistic self defense methods, athletic martial arts training, functional fitness, and the overall martial lifestyle. We are the operating chapter of the Jeet Kune Do Athletic Association for the greater Augusta, GA area.</p>
            <p>Established in 2010, our studio began as Superior Self Defense Academy (SSDA), where students trained a variety of self defense systems, as well as Bruce Lee’s Jeet Kune Do. Since that time we have been the CSRA’s leader for realistic self-defense and martial arts.  We are the only academy in Augusta, GA and the CSRA teaching Jeet Kune Do. Jeet Kune Do has been cited as the “ultimate fighting art” by Black Belt magazine and was founded by the late Bruce Lee. At our academy, you will receive training under a direct Bruce Lee lineage.</p>

            <p>As of late 2015, Sifu Kyle McGahee, who has been teaching at the school for over 5 years, purchased Superior Self Defense Academy. The studio has been renamed the Southeast JKD Athletic Club (Southeast JKD for short) to reflect our focus on Jeet Kune Do exclusively.</p>
            <p>We believe in preserving and spreading the philosophy and training methods used by Sijo Bruce Lee and Guro Dan Inosanto, as well as other masters of various styles of martial arts. We teach the arts of Jeet Kune Do and Filipino Kali, as well as incorporate techniques and strategies from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Kina Mutai, MMA, Boxing, Savate &amp; Muay Thai to promote health, wellness, and practical self-defense skills.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to help our members develop a strong character, a healthy body, and a peaceful mind. The training is suitable for all ages, as the learning environment is both safe and friendly.</p>

<section><h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    
    <p>The mission of the Jeet Kune Do Athletic Association is to “preserve and perpetuate the Jeet Kune Do way of life.” As the Southeast chapter of the Jeet Kune Do Athletic Assocation, we are also dedicated to this mission. By providing world-class instruction, we offer our students the ability to train their body, and their mind, in order to enrich and enhance their lives in all aspects. Our instructors and our students achieve excellence through hard work, discipline and perseverance.  We operate on simple values, such as respect, honor, loyalty, positivity, compassion, modesty and integrity.</p>
    <p>We are sincerely dedicated to the success of our members and students. This is what drives us. It is what we do on a daily basis. We offer low student-instructor ratios, personalized feedback, and an inclusive atmosphere. We operate from a simple belief that our members are our focus, and we provide honest, sincere direction and coaching. At Southeast JKD, you will never walk in and feel like you aren’t welcomed, or are forgotten the moment you sign up.</p>
    <p>To accomplish this, we do not believe you should be required to sign up for long-term contracts, or a 3 year “Black Belt” training commitment. Nor do we believe that you will receive the same level of attention and focus on your goals for $40 per month at some other gym or academy.</p>
    <p>You don’t have to take our word for it. Give us a call. Schedule a time to come by and experience a class. Only then can you decide what is right for you.</p> </section>
