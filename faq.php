<ol><li>Do you participate in any Competitions?
        <p>Our students can compete in a variety of things including - Mixed Martial Arts, Boxing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Submission Grappling, as well as Traditional Martial Arts Tournaments. Speak with us about any specific interests you may have.</p></li>
    <li>Do you Teach Reality Based Self Defense?
        <p>We teach the same systems taught to Navy Seals, CIA, DEA, DOD, FBI, Secret Service, Homeland Security, US Martials, Various Special Operation Groups and Over 50 Police Departments. Our programs will help develop Killer Insinct and Emotional Control through Stress Inoculation Training. We will put you though scenarios that will Include street fights, muggings, carjackings, home break-ins, and terrorist attacks.</p></li>
    <li>What Martial Art do you Teach?
        <p>Since no one art has it all, we teach Bruce Lee's Concepts and Philosophies called Jeet Kune Do, as well as techniques and strategies from Boxing, Wing Chun, Savate, Muay Thai, Tai Chi, and Fencing. We also utilize grappling arts such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Wrestling, and Judo. In addition to that we teach other less known arts such as Kali, Dumog, Panantukan, Pananjakman, and Kino Mutai.</p></li>
    <li>Do you Include Weapons Training? What kinds?
        <p>We work with Edged Weapons, Blunt Weapons, Improvised Weapons, and Even Firearms.</p></li>
    <li>With all these things how do I know which class to take?
        <p>That is the best part, most martial arts schools that teach multiple arts and systems divide them up making it difficult and forcing you to do several classes just to become well rounded. At Southeast Jeet Kune Do, we include all the above material into only a few separate classes. The classes are offered several times a week and no two classes are the same. The Self Defense 101 class is adapted from Jeet Kune Do and Kali, and is great for beginners or even seasoned practitioners looking to increase their knowledge of modern self-defense! Our other classes include JKD Kickboxing, Freestyle Grappling, and Kali (Filipino weapons fighting) to help build the attributes and athleticism for those looking to get in better shape, or who are even thinking about competing.</p> </li>
    <li>What if I only want to do MMA and I am not Interested in Streetfighting or Self Defense?
        <p>We are focused on the big picture and if you want to compete, we have something to offer. Our JKD Kickboxing classes, along with our Freestyle Grappling classes will provide you with the knowledge and tools to compete in MMA.</p>
        <p>However, along with the sport fighting, you will learn techniques from other arts that will help you to defend yourself on the street.</p>
        <p>We believe in giving you the tools to be a well-rounded martial artist, not just a fighter or someone who knows “a little self defense.” By training both areas, you will gain confidence in your ability to handle yourself inside of a ring or out!</p></li>
    <li>What if I am only interested in Realistic Self Defense and have no Interest in Competing?
        <p>Most self defense schools focus on teaching techniques and skills for people who have no formal training. We do train our students for this type of situation in our Self Defense 101 classes.</p></li></ol>
<p>However, we want to prepare you to survive any encounter, including being attacked by a skilled opponent. You do not need to be a Jiu-Jitsu master but you must understand basic ground fighting to be able to get back to your feet. You do not have to be a boxing champ but you must know how to deal with punches. In light of this, we feel it is important that you cross-train with the same methods used by professional fighters, boxers, and athletes. That doesn’t mean that you will have to compete, but training this way will enhance your ability to respond to stressful situations.</p>
